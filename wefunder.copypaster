What is the short version of your name for our website?

  Public Domain Publishing

What is your 10 second pitch?

  Ensure every child on earth has access to humanity's best
  information.

What are the best reasons someone might want to invest...

  1. We build public domain software, databases and online
  communities.

  2. We monetize events, run classifieds, and monetize
  feature prioritization.

  3. Looking for investors that believe in the public domain.

  4. Looking for investors excited by our software capabilities.

  5. Looking for investors with relevant skills, networks
  and resources to help us.

  6. This will be a rocket crash. Grab your popcorn! You
  will probably lose your entire investment.

  7. Invest only if you'd feel comfortable liking a

What does your company do?

  We make public domain software, databases and online
  communities. 📰

Where do you want to be in 5 years?

  We want to live in a world where all the top publishers
  are publishing entirely to the public domain. 🗽

Why did you choose this idea? Why do you care?

  Imagine if the world built a machine that could beam
  healthy meals instantly to every child on earth. The world
  already has invented that machine for the mind but hasn't
  yet turned it on. 🧬

How far along are you? What's your biggest obstacle?

  We have 50,000+ users a month interacting with our
  products but they are not good enough yet to monetize 🔨.

Who competes with you? What do you understand that they
don't?

  We compete against lie factories 🏭.

  We understand the value in liberated ideas and know that
  the public domain is the right way to treat ideas and
  people. 🗽

How will you make money?

  We will sell feature prioritization, tickets to events,
  and old-fashioned classifieds. 💰

What are the biggest risks? If you fail, what would be the
reason? What has to go right for you to succeed?

  For us to succeed we need to build a great team of people
  committed to public domain, manage our limited resources
  well, build great things, and not get killed by goliath.

What is your Deck?

  WARNING: You will probably lose your whole investment. Do NOT invest.
  The terms are favorable, but that is because this will be a DISASTER. Avoid
  at all costs.

  The Public Domain Publishing Company will be your standard
  for-profit media conglomerate with a twist: everything we
  publish will be released into the public domain.
  
  Our current portfolio includes software, databases,
  and communities that have over 50,000 monthly users and
  growing. A partial list of our portfolio is on the
  website, but the entire portfolio will remain a company
  secret (Even in the public domain, you don't show the
  world your gameplan before the Super Bowl).
  
  Over the next 6 months the focus will be on building a team
  of 4-6 cofounders and launch our first revenue generating
  products.
