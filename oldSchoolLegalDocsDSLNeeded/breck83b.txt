@IRSnews Dear IRS. I notice you don't have a place on your website to file an 83(b). Even during a pandemic. It would take you about 30 minutes to set one up. In lieu of that, please consider this my filing of my 83(b). Thanks!

I, John Breckinridge Yunits, hereby declare and swear to almighty Zeus that I have bought these near worthless shares/options for $10 and am electing to do the 83(b) thing that everyone recommends so that I'm not taxed at unfair rates.

This thing that I'm doing is the thing referenced here: https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/equity#what-is-an-83b-election
