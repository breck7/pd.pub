What is your company going to make?

  Our first product is 📜 Scroll. Scroll is like Wordpress or
  Jekyll but different in 3 important ways:

  1. Uses an infinitely extensible new language a quantum
  leap better than Markdown.
  2. Designed for syntopic reading.
  3. Targeted exclusively toward people passionate about the
  public domain.

  In general we make public domain software, databases and
  online communities. 🗽

did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?


If you have already participated or committed to participate
in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program,
please tell us about it.



Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain
expertise in this area? How do you know people need what
you're making?

  Early Napster users. 🎧

What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do
people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't
know about it)?

  We are the first media startup to just say "fuck it let's
  publish everything to the public domain." 🚀🚀🚀

Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors?
Who do you fear most?

  If all of media and tech switches to public domain we will go
  out of business 💥 but will have succeeded in our mission.

What do you understand about your business that other
companies in it just don't get?

  Public domain is the right way to treat ideas and
  treat people. Do what's right and the rest will take care
  of itself. This is the way. 🗽


How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
  
  Every Scroll comes with a "Buy Printed Copy" version so
  true fans can buy a paper copy of their favorite site
  that will last 100 years. We handle all the logistics. We
  could make enough to buy a 🍌.

How will you get users?

  Filter our most 🤩 users amongst our current
  users, build what they love, and repeat.
